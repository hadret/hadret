### Cześć! 👋🏻

🤷🏻‍♂️ I'm an Infrastructure Engineer at [Ghost](https://ghost.org), dedicated to
keeping Ghost(Pro) up and running 24/7.

🔭 I’m currently exploring scaling solutions using
[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) and [Cilium](https://cilium.io). My homelab
serves as a battleground for improving my skills in these areas. [My terrible
shell scripting](https://github.com/hadret/tss) does help quite a bit in this
endeavor!

Oh, yeah, I have a [blog](https://chabik.com) that might catch your interest.
Provided you like blogs. And reading. Recently, I bootstrapped my [Personal
Package Archive for Debian](https://deb.chabik.com).

📫 Want to reach out? You can find me on
[Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@hadret) or via [email](hadret@gmail.com).

🔒 Here's my GPG key fingerprint, it's cool, right? `3637 EE58 8760 A832 6A43
